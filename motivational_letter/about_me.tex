  I am interested in programmer position in Computas company. For past 20 years I've been following IT industry trends an adopted the ones I found suited my needs of the moment. At the moment I'm most familiar with Python when it comes to backend solutions, data analysis and database interactions and Flutter for fronted development. I've heard from Knut Hjelmseth that your company is always in need of capable developers so I'd like to put my name in the hat.

  For the past 2 years I was working as an executive officer in  Natural history museum under University of Oslo on \textit{Natur i Endring} project. My job was to develop fullstack solution for citizen-science data gathering of treeline and forest line geospatial data in Norway. This job required combining a lot of technologies to work together for consistent data gathering and subsequent analysis to work. I was the only programmer on the project but my work was based on the designs of our dedicated designers and followed clearly specified layout inputs from specialists in the field of spatial data collection. Project ended up being success with more than 3000 users in first year and multiple mentions in newspapers and TV networks \cite{newspaper1,newspaper2,newspaper3,newspaper4,newspaper5,tv1,tv2}.
